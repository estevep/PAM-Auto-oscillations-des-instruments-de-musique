	abstract = {This paper proposes a methodology to map the various acoustic regimes of wind instruments. The maps can be generated in a multi-dimensional space consisting of design, control parameters, and initial conditions. The boundaries of the maps are obtained explicitly in terms of the parameters using a support vector machine (SVM) classiﬁer as well as a dedicated adaptive sampling scheme. The approach is demonstrated on a simpliﬁed clarinet model for which several maps are generated based on diﬀerent criteria. Examples of computation of the probability of occurrence of a speciﬁc acoustic regime are also provided. In addition, the approach is demonstrated on a design optimization example for optimal intonation.},

	issn = {0001-4966, 1520-8524},
	doi = {10.1121/1.390157},
	abstract = {The time-domain description of musical and other nonlinear oscillators complements the more commonly used frequency-domain description, and is advantageous for some purposes. It is especially advantageous when studying large-amplitude oscillations, for which nonlinearity may be severe. It gives direct insight into the physical reasons for the variation of waveform as playing conditions vary, and into certain phenomena which may seem counter-intuitive from the frequency-domain viewpoint, such as the musically undesirable flattening in the pitch of a bowed string when the bow is pressed too hard onto the string. It is easy to set up efficient time-domain simulations on a small computer, a fact that has been surprisingly little exploited in musical acoustics. The simplest relevant model is described here. It demonstrates some of the basic nonlinear behavior of the clarinet, violin, and flute families with very little programming effort. Remarkably, a single set of model equations has relevance to all three cases, at a certain level of idealization, with appropriate choices of parameter values and of linear and nonlinear characteristics. For the flute family, this simplest model gives waveforms and phase relations closely resembling those observed at resonance in the organ-pipe experiments of Coltman [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 60, 725–733 (1976)], including the triangular pressure and velocity waveforms. It can be shown (again using a time-domain approach) that the triangular waveform is a universal limiting form, independent of detailed acoustic loss mechanisms provided losses are small.},

	volume = {90},
	abstract = {Elementary models of the bowed string and of woodwinds are reviewed in order to underline their analogy. The comparison of the pressure-ﬂow characteristics of a woodwind with the friction characteristics of a bowed string shows that the mouth pressure and the bow velocity on the one hand, and a static ﬂow parameter for the embouchure and the static force applied by the instrumentalist perpendicularly to the motion of the string on the other hand are analogous parameters. Using idealized resonators, conical resonators are found to be analogous to a string bowed elsewhere than at the middle, the position of the bow being analogous to the length of the truncation of the conical tube. A consequence of these analogies is that idealized woodwinds can be modeled with two reﬂection functions like a bowed string, and that some references dealing with the bowed string can be useful to study reed woodwinds. The behaviour of common solutions, including the Helmholtz motion, is ﬁnally detailed within the scope of Raman’s model applied to woodwinds.},
