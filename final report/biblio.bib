The maps can be generated in a multi-dimensional space consisting of design, control parameters, and initial conditions. The boundaries of the maps are obtained explicitly in terms of the parameters using a support vector machine (SVM) classiﬁer as well as a dedicated adaptive sampling scheme. The approach is demonstrated on a simpliﬁed clarinet model for which several maps are generated based on diﬀerent criteria. Examples of computation of the probability of occurrence of a speciﬁc acoustic regime are also provided. In addition, the approach is demonstrated on a design optimization example for optimal intonation.},

	abstract = {The time-domain description of musical and other nonlinear oscillators complements the more commonly used frequency-domain description, and is advantageous for some purposes. It is especially advantageous when studying large-amplitude oscillations, for which nonlinearity may be severe. It gives direct insight into the physical reasons for the variation of waveform as playing conditions vary, and into certain phenomena which may seem counter-intuitive from the frequency-domain viewpoint, such as the musically undesirable flattening in the pitch of a bowed string when the bow is pressed too hard onto the string. It is easy to set up efficient time-domain simulations on a small computer, a fact that has been surprisingly little exploited in musical acoustics. The simplest relevant model is described here. It demonstrates some of the basic nonlinear behavior of the clarinet, violin, and flute families with very little programming effort. Remarkably, a single set of model equations has relevance to all three cases, at a certain level of idealization, with appropriate choices of parameter values and of linear and nonlinear characteristics. For the flute family, this simplest model gives waveforms and phase relations closely resembling those observed at resonance in the organ-pipe experiments of Coltman [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 60, 725–733 (1976)], including the triangular pressure and velocity waveforms. It can be shown (again using a time-domain approach) that the triangular waveform is a universal limiting form, independent of detailed acoustic loss mechanisms provided losses are small.},

	volume = {90},
	abstract = {Elementary models of the bowed string and of woodwinds are reviewed in order to underline their analogy. The comparison of the pressure-ﬂow characteristics of a woodwind with the friction characteristics of a bowed string shows that the mouth pressure and the bow velocity on the one hand, and a static ﬂow parameter for the embouchure and the static force applied by the instrumentalist perpendicularly to the motion of the string on the other hand are analogous parameters. Using idealized resonators, conical resonators are found to be analogous to a string bowed elsewhere than at the middle, the position of the bow being analogous to the length of the truncation of the conical tube. A consequence of these analogies is that idealized woodwinds can be modeled with two reﬂection functions like a bowed string, and that some references dealing with the bowed string can be useful to study reed woodwinds. The behaviour of common solutions, including the Helmholtz motion, is ﬁnally detailed within the scope of Raman’s model applied to woodwinds.},

  abstract = {The paper presents a method to obtain the modal expansion of the measured input impedance of a brass instrument. The method operates as a peak-picking procedure, which makes it particularly intuitive for users who are not experts in modal analysis. To bypass the limitation of usual peak-picking approaches, which are valid only for well separated resonances, the present method is based on a semi-local optimization problem. It consists in adjusting the frequency and damping of one mode at a time while taking into account the presence of all other modes in the basis. The practical application of the method involves four elementary actions, which can be chained in different ways to progressively approximate a measured input impedance. This procedure is illustrated through the approximation of the input impedance of a bass trombone. The supervised nature of the method allows the user to favour modes that have a physical meaning, i.e. that can be associated with a resonance peak. A single spurious mode can however be deliberately introduced to approximate the input impedance curve beyond the last visible peak. The method applies directly to the frequency-domain data provided by an impedance sensor and does not require any preprocessing. Nevertheless, it is fairly robust to noisy data. Since the method allows a reconstruction of the input impedance using either complex modes or real modes, results obtained with each approximation are critically compared.},

The different thresholds are shown to depend on parameters related to embouchure parameters and to the absorption coefficient in the pipe. Their values determine the dynamic range of the fundamental oscillations and the bifurcation scheme at the extinction.},

This leads to time oscillations that are represented by square signals, analogous to the Raman regime for string instruments. In this article, we study in more detail the properties of the corresponding non-linear iterations, with emphasis on the geometrical constructions that can be used to classify the various solutions (for instance with or without reed beating) as well as on the periodicity windows that occur within the chaotic region. In particular, we find a regime where period tripling occurs and examine the conditions for intermittency. We also show that, while the direct observation of the iteration function does not reveal much on the oscillation regime of the instrument, the graph of the high order iterates directly gives visible information on the oscillation regime (characterization of the number of period doubligs, chaotic behaviour, etc.).},
